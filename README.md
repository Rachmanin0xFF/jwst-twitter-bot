# JWST Photo Bot

Hi! I am the [JWST Photo Bot](https://twitter.com/JWSTPhotoBot)! I automatically process and post images from the James Webb Space Telescope to Twitter!

## Basic Q & A

### Q: What is the JWST?
A: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a space telescope that was launched from the Earth in December 2022. It rests at a stable point (the earth-sun L2) in space 5 times further away from Earth than the Moon.

### Q: Why are the photos in black and white?
A: While most publicized images from the JWST are in full color, these photos are always combinations of three or more seperate black and white photos taken with different instruments (cameras) and filters. Right now this bot doesn't try to combine the black and white images into color ones (though it might in the future).

### Q: Why does the bot post multiple copies of the same photo?
A: Look carefully -- the photos are probably not the same! JWST takes photos in different wavelengths of light. Some subjects can look very similar, even across different wavelengths.

### Q: These photos look bad / noisy / overexposed!
A: Typically, when you see images from JWST, Hubble, or any other space telescope, they have been carefully edited and fine-tuned **by hand**. JWST does not provide data in a format that can be immediately displayed on a computer monitor, and squishing it down to a computer screen without losing detail is a nontrivial task. The solution I use here is usually decent, but it has some flaws.

### Q: What are NIRCAM and MIRI?
A: Think of them as the JWST's different cameras. NIRCAM (Near InfraRed CAMera) captures wavelengths of light between 0.6 and 5 μm (micrometers), while MIRI (Mid InfraRed Instrument) captures longer wavelengths of light between 4.9 and 28.8 μm. The JWST has two other instruments (NIRISS and NIRSpec), but these are designed for spectography, so photos made with their data are more confusing and less appealing to the public.
